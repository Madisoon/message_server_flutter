                    child: Text("123"),
                    onTap: () {},
                  );
```


```
enum HitTestBehavior {
  /// Targets that defer to their children receive events within their bounds
  /// only if one of their children is hit by the hit test.
  deferToChild, //只生效在child的区域比如文字

  /// Opaque targets can be hit by hit tests, causing them to both receive
  /// events within their bounds and prevent targets visually behind them from
  /// also receiving events.
  opaque,//GestureDetector的整个区域，不包括它下面的区域

  /// Translucent targets both receive events within their bounds and permit
  /// targets visually behind them to also receive events.
  translucent,// GestureDetector的整个区域以及它下面的区域
}
